This directory contains this project's C implementation. To build it, you will need to install the following:

* CMake
* GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP)

On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions, the following command will install both:
sudo apt-get install cmake libgmp-dev

On CentOS and other Red Hat-based distributions, the following command will install both:
sudo yum install cmake gmp-devel

On other UNIX-like platforms, both of these projects are likely included in their respective package distribution systems.

Note that this implementation does not work on Windows platforms.
