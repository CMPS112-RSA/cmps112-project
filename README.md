CMPS 112 Winter 2016 - RSA Implementation Comparison
=====================================================

This project compares four implementations of a simplified and smaller-scale RSA standard. Each implementation uses language-specific features that distinguish them from the other implementations. Comparing these shows various strengths and weaknesses inherent in each language.

Information on the RSA standard used in this project can be found in **RSA-standard.txt**.
